With our basic axiom scheme in place we can begin revisiting the classical notion of a derivative in this new context. We begin, as expected, with a function \( f:R\to R \). First let us paint a geometric picture. The set \( D \) is meant to represent the infinitesimals. They are such small entities that every function from them is linear. This recovers the intuitive or historical conception of calculus: for very tiny increments in \( x \) the change produced in \( f(x) \) is indistinguishable from a straight line. The derivative of \( f \) at \( x \) is the slope of this line.
