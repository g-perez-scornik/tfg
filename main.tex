\abstract{The goal of this monograph is to explore the basic axiomatic theory of Synthetic Differential
Geometry. In case the reader is not familiar, Synthetic Differential Geometry (SDG) refers to
a field of study which aims to put the study of smooth manifolds and geometry therein, in
a topos-theoretic framework. Though the full depth of application and consequences of SDG
require knowledge of topos-theory to comprehend, a large part of the theory can be appreciated
with only some notions of basic category theory (as well as with a standard undergraduate
mathematics syllabus). In this work we look at this part of SDG, called the “axiomatic” theory
because it is indeed developed axiomatically. Specifically, under the axiomatic theory of SDG
we look at differential calculus, then “Manifolds” (their analogue in SDG), vector bundles (the
tangent bundle as a particular case), and vector fields (and the Lie algebras thereof).}
