\chapter{Further topics}

In this last section we'll give a quick overview of some important topics in SDG that were not covered here (but are readily found in the source material). The first subsection will describe those topics that, similarly to the material covered here, are essentially ways in which SDG reinterprets long-existing subjects from classical geometry, while the last subsection will deal with a matter particular to SDG - that of models.
